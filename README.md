## Counting Sundays in Haskell. ##

**What does the helper function (sundays') calculate?**

"sundays'" calculates the total number of Sundays which is on the first day of the month and keep recursion untill the given parameter (end year) is reached.

**What if you don't define a "rest" and use its expression where it's needed?**

It would create code redundancy, and also in Haskell, using guards rather than nested if statements is a better coding practice.
